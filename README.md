# Alchemy DAO Scheme Param Hash Generator
 
## Gettings Started

### Smart Contract 

In `./blockchain`:

```
truffle develop
> compile
> migrate
```

This will provide a contract address and test private keys with ETH. 

### Client

In `./client`:

```
yarn
yarn start 
```

Replace the contract address with the one provided by migrate in `App.js`.
